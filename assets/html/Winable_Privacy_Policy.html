Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Winable 11 has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Winable 11’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Winable 11 does not control.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">Winable 11's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. </span><span class="T2">Winable 11 uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal, and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Winable 11's visitors come.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Links:</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">Winable 11 also includes links to other websites.

That policy may differ from Winable 11's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information. Winable 11 is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T3">Security Procedures:</span></p><p class="P3"><span class="T2">All information gathered on Winable 11 is securely stored within Winable 11- controlled database.
